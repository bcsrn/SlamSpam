They work excellent! I hooked them up to my systems, and am very happy with the quality - Fast Speed, and 3D support. They are $12. for a 10 footer! That's a good buy - a lot better than spending $45. for a six foot Monster cable! I find so many great products, for great prices at Amazon,and shopping at Amazon saves me so Much time of having to search all over the net, Amazon Rocks!\n",

It feels much more substantial than the Amazon cables. Although I have to give props to the Amazon cable for better flexibility, cause its so thin. Have not tried it with 3D content yet, but wanted to be prepared. No specific complaint, just that the Amazon cable construction feels cheaper. Only time will tell, but I'll probably stick with MediaBridge in the future since they have the best warranty.\n",
