According to a 2019 study from Fakespot, 30 percent of Amazon reviews are fake or unreliable. As e-commerce becomes more and
more popular over the years, the reviews from customers grow rapidly and people tend to rely on Amazon reviews to make pur-
chasing decisions. However, there are competitor companies who hire people or use tools to write fake reviews in order to promote
their own products demote their competitors’ products. These fake reviews are degrading the quality of customers’ overall online
shopping experience. In the long run, this makes it hard for verified sellers to protect themselves, not to say diminishes the credibility
of Amazon review system. How to detect fake reviews is essentially important. There are some automated tools such as Reviewskeptic
and ReviewAlarm, we on the other hand propose to take approach of opinion mining to solve this problem. Opinion mining is also
known as sentiment analysis or emotion AI, it evaluates people’s opinions and classifies people’s opinions into positive, negative,
or neutral based upon text or sentences from a document. Furthermore, we propose to take advantage of feature-based opinion
mining where different features can generate different sentiment responses.
